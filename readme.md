# An Invitation to Probability
* June 8th, 2022, from 5:30pm -- 6:30pm.
* [Sciences Center Auditorium Building](https://calendar.auburn.edu/sciences_center_auditorium_bldg_603)
* Lecturer: [Le Chen](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lzc0090/)
* Slides are here [SSI_Invitation_Probability_Le.pdf](./slides/SSI_Invitation_Probability_Le.pdf).

## Procedures
* Each one is assigned an ID number.
* Present the slides.
* Collecting the DOB via the ID number using [sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im):
```
sc-im ./slides/codes/DOB.csv
```
* Run [Checking.py](./slides/codes/Checking.py) to check the matching DOBs from the class.
* Run [GenDOB.py](./slides/codes/GenDOB.py) to generate random DOBs uniformly distributed in years
  2005 -- 2007.
* Run [BatchTest.py](./slides/codes/BatchTest.py) to generate random classes and to see if one can
  recover the theoretical matching probability.
